Alia Bhatt may not marry Ranbir Kapoor anytime soon. She reveals why

Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt make a lovely pair and there are no two ways about it. The lovebirds, on a regular basis, keep making headlines. Yet, fans just can’t get enough of them. Ranbir and Alia’s latest photo, that had them celebrating the Valentine’s Day with a private dinner, got their admirers excited like never before. While fans are eagerly waiting for the couple to tie the knot, the two apparently want to take their time before taking their relationship to the next level.

In a recent interview to DNA, Alia opened up on the rumours surrounding her wedding. She said, “I don’t understand the need for everyone to discuss this all the time. But then, I think to myself that it’s a simple question and my answer remains the same. If I’m not getting married right now, that’s what I’ll say. I’m happy being in a relationship, but that doesn’t mean I’m tying the knot just yet.”

On being asked as to when she was planning to get hitched, the actress said, “I’m too young to think about it. When I feel there’s a need to be in a stronger bond with him, we will come to it. But right now, I’m married to my work and I also have my relationship going well on the side.”

On the film front, Alia is currently riding high on the success of her recent release Gully Boy. The Zoya Akhtar-directed film has Ranveer Singh paired opposite her. She also has films Kalank, Brahmastra, Sadak 2 and Takht in her kitty.

Ranbir, on the other hand, was last seen in Sanju, the highest-grossing film of the last year. His current slate of films includes Brahmastra and Shamshera.
