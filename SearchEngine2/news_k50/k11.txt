DNA reported that in a talk show, Kat clarified it all and spoke about Salman's reaction upon her joining the film.

The pretty actress said, â€œSalman Khan didn't call me at all, he didn't say a word to me. And this is the truth. He did not even call me... Even when I signed the film, he didn't call me."

She further added, "When I went for the first day, I don't know something they were doing and he went like Katrina with a head nod and I am like okay.. fine."

The actress also revealed that there is never a dull moment with Salman. She said, "He is unpredictable which is why every moment with him is fascinating. There's never a dull moment with Salman."

For the unversed, earlier, actress Priyanka Chopra was supposed to play the female lead in 'Bharat'. However, Pee Cee backed out of the project at the last minute and in place of her, Katrina was roped in.
