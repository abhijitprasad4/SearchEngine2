Katrina Kaif on being single: Don't know if I will ever be able to date

Katrina Kaif, who broke up with longtime boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor in 2016, has opened up on her relationship status. The actress said that she is very much single.

Katrina Kaif and Ranbir Kapoor's break-up left their fans shocked and devastated. But three years since they parted ways, the ex-lovers have finally moved on. While Ranbir has found love in Brahmastra co-actor Alia Bhatt, Katrina hasn't talked much about her love life ever since.

But for the first time the 35-year-old actress has opened up on her relationship status. The Thugs of Hindostan, who recently appeared on a chat show, was asked why she isn't dating anyone. To which she replied, "I really don't know and.... I don't know that I will ever be able to do that."

When asked if she is claiming to be single right now, Katrina said, "as single as one can possibly be."

Interestingly, she is one the last few singles in Bollywood because most of her contemopraries like Priyanka Chopra, Deepika Padukone and Sonam Kapoor are hitched now.

And Bollywood's Chikni Chameli has a hilarious reaction to this.

Katrina Kaif also opened up on everyone getting married in Bollywood. She said, "I am like everyone's getting married, wait... don't leave me behind."

On the work front, Katrina was last seen with Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma in Zero. The film bombed at the box office, but the actress was lauded for her role. Katrina played the role of an actress battling alcoholism.

Currently, she is busy shooting for Ali Abbas Zafar's Bharat with Salman Khan. After Priyanka Chopra made an impromptu exit from the film owing to her wedding with Nick, Katrina stepped into her shoes. The film is an official remake of a Korean film, An Ode To My Father. The film is set to hit the screens this Eid.
