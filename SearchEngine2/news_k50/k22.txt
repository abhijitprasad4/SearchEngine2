Katrina Kaif REVEALS Salman Khan's reaction after she came on board for 'Bharat' post Priyanka Chopra's exit

It's a known fact that Katrina Kaif was roped in to play the female lead in Bharat after Priyanka Chopra backed out from the film just a few days before the shoot. The director of Bharat, Ali Abbas Zafar and the lead actor Salman Khan spoke several times about the same at various occasions. From last year, Katrina has been shooting for Bharat in full swing and even headed to Abu Dhabi, Malta, North India among other places for various schedules.

Earlier, it was reported that it was Salman who wanted Katrina to play the female lead in Bharat. However, in a recent talk show, Katrina clarified it all! She shared, "Salman Khan didn't call me at all, he didn't say a word to me. And this is the truth. He did not even call me... Even when I signed the film, he didn't call me." She further spoke about what happened on the first day of the shoot. Katrina added, "When I went for the first day, I don't know something they were doing and he went like Katrina with a head nod and I am like okay.. fine."

The stunning actor was all praises for Salman and revealed there's never a dull moment with him. She said, "He is unpredictable which is why every moment with him is fascinating. There's never a dull moment with Salman."

Speaking about Bharat's script, Katrina went on to say, "I read the script, something connected to me very strongly. I didn't expect it, in my mind I had envisioned another kind of role which he had written for the heroine in Bharat, so I was like whatever. When I read it, I was very surprised. It's like a light switch that goes... I saw this opportunity of some desire to do something with this character. I saw it like this is what I want to do."

Bharat is slated to release during the Eid weekend this year.
