Katrina Kaif reveals she knew Alia Bhatt even before Student of the Year, so her dating Ranbir Kapoor can't change their equation


Katrina is absolutely fine being friends with Alia Bhatt.

A lot has been said and written about Katrina Kaif and Alia Bhatt's friendship ever since the Raazi actress started dating Kat's ex-boyfriend Ranbir Kapoor. But, time and again, both Kat and Alia have maintained that they are thick friends. The two are not letting the common factor between them affect their friendship. And once again, the Tiger Zinda Hai actress has made it clear. Recently, in conversation with Filmfare, Katrina opened up about the failure of Thugs Of Hindostan, her reunion with Salman, her equation with Alia Bhatt among many other things. In short, the actress spoke about everything under the sun. And we are glad she was candid about everything. 

Coming to her friendship with Alia, Katrina revealed that Ayan Mukerji introduced the Raazi actress to her even before Student Of The Year released. "Alia was part of our friends' circle of Ayan, me and there was a group of us. She still hadn't started Student Of The Year and Ayan introduced us to her saying, 'This is Alia, she's going to be doing a film with Karan. They're going to be starting Student Of The Year. Then we always had a nice, you know, a warm equation. I think when she started coming to train with Yasmin, that's when we started seeing each other more and then I would say, come train with me," she said.

When asked if the person whom Alia is dating hampers their relationship, the actress was quick to say, "Who she was dating was not relevant to the equation that I shared with her so why should that equation change." We feel this brings an end to all the speculations and rumours about Katrina and Alia's friendship hitting the rock bottom, what do you think?
