Katrina Kaif says 'words fall short to describe' Alia Bhatt in Gully Boy, here's how the latter responded

Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boy, starring Ranveer Singh and Alia Bhatt, has found fans in the biggest names of the film fraternity. From Will Smith showering praise on Ranveer to Bollywood going gaga over the film, there's no stopping the praise for the film and rightly so. 

But while Ranveer's Murad has officially paved its way to become one of the most loved characters of the recent times, Alia's Safeena, too, has marked an indelible impact on the cine-goers. And joining the list of Gully Boy fans is Katrina Kaif. 

The actor took to Instagram to share her opinion on the film. While Katrina had the nicest things to say about the film, its cast and the director, Zoya Akhtar, it's her delightful words for Alia that have caught our attention. She wrote, “Alia Bhatt you light up the screen, words fall short to describe you.”

Alia was quick to respond to Katrina's comment. Re-sharing Katrina's story, Alia called her the “Best person”. 

There were reports that Alia's relationship with Ranbir didn't go down well with Katrina. But the latter, in a recent interaction with Famously Filmfare, cleared the air about it all saying that who Alia was dating is “not relevant” to the equation she shared with her. 

Katrina also showered praise on Zoya calling her a “leader” and a “visionary” and wrote, “My dearest Zoya Akhtar, your time is here and how. You are such a leader and visionary, so fearless and always forging a new path.” Mighty impressed with Ranveer, she wrote, “Ranveer Singh all heart and soul, what craft RESPECT.”

Katrina also gave a special shoutout to Siddhant Chaturvedi for his “phenomenal unforgettable performance.”
