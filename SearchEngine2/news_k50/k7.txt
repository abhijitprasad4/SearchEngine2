Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif have not just done multiple films together, but the actress is very close to Salman’s family. In addition to that, the actress was rumoured to be dating Salman before she got into a relationship with Ranbir Kapoor. And now that both of them claim that they are single, fans have often said that they would like to see the two stars together. Recently, a fan posted the same thing on social media and Katrina even had a reaction.

Katrina was a guest on Famously Filmfare when she was shown a comment by a fan on Salman’s 'Bharat' poster. The comment was, "Plz mam he is parfait to you plzzz shadi karlo please." To this Katrina first started laughing and then just said, "Hmmm… that’s my reaction."


On the show, Katrina was also asked by a fan when will she get married, and she said, "I really don't know. Unfortunately, it takes two to tango in this equation. So, when I get someone good then yes."
