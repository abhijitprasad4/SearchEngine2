Salman Khan always cheers up Katrina Kaif, even if he’s physically not around – here’s how

We are waiting for Katrina to groove to the tunes of OO Jaane Jaana soon.

Another hit Bollywood track from the '90s is being remade and it is none other than Salman Khan's song O O Jaane Jaana from Pyaar Kiya To Darna Kya. Yes, the song which was a huge hit back in the day is reportedly being revamped for Sooraj Pancholi and Isabelle Kaif starrer Time To Dance. And the ones who will be featuring in the track are Salman and Katrina. While there is no confirmation for it from the makers, but Kat has already started prepping for the dance number. Or let just say, she has been grooving to Salman's track for a long time. 

Recently, when the actress appeared on Jitesh Pillai's talk show, Katrina revealed how she would start performing to O O Jaane Jana whenever she felt low. "O O Jane Jaana, that’s my favourite one. It’s too funny and I just love it. It’s my hobby and I do it when I’m feeling low. On the set, if I’m feeling low or something I just start performing to the song,” in a candid mood, Katrina Kaif said," she said. We are glad to know that even when Salman is not physically around her, his song lifts up the actress' mood.

During the same chat, Kat stated that she would want Salman Khan to be the narrator of her biopic as the actor has played a fairly large part in her life. That's one candid confession, we say! Meanwhile, on the work front, Katrina will be seen in Bharat opposite Khan, which is helmed by Ali Abbas Zafar.
