Bharat – Here’s how Salman Khan REACTED when Katrina Kaif entered the sets of the film on the first day!

Katrina Kaif and Salman Khan will reunite onscreen after their much successful Tiger franchise, Tiger Zinda Hai. Interestingly, they are also reuniting with the filmmaker Ali Abbas Zafar with their next Bharat. The actress, like many would know, was not the first choice for the role which initially featured Priyanka Chopra. However after the latter backed out, Kat came on board. But Kaif’s entry spread rumours that it was Salman who suggested Katrina’s name. Now that the film is in its final schedule, Katrina shunned all rumours revealing that Salman wasn’t even aware that she was approached for the role.

The casting of the leading lady of Bharat created enough speculations about the relations of Salman Khan, Priyanka Chopra and Katrina Kaif. While Salman put an end to all the rumours about his alleged cold war with Priyanka after he attended her wedding reception with Nick Jonas, the actor we hear wasn’t even aware that Katrina had come on board. As per what Katrina Kaif said in latest reports, the actress asserted that Salman never made a call to her for Bharat.

She stated in a recent chat show, according to reports, that Salman Khan didn’t call her before or even after signing Bharat. When she visited the sets of the film, Salman, who was busy at that time, surprisingly called out her name and nodding his head. Interestingly, Ali Abbas Zafar, the director of Bharat, too is one of Katrina’s best friends!

Katrina Kaif was also praises for her co-star Salman Khan wherein she told that there is never a dull moment with the superstar, mainly because he is quite unpredictable.

Coming to Bharat, the film also stars Disha Patani, Jackie Shroff, Tabu, and Sunil Grover in prominent roles and the film is expected to release during Eid this year. It is an Indian adaptation of the Korean drama Ode To My Father.
