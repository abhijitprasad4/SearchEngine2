The film is loosely based on the story of rappers Divine and Naezy.

Gully Boy opened to good reviews. In her review, Indian Express film critic Shubhra Gupta wrote, ‚ÄúGully Boy is the story of a young man breaking free through street rap. Zoya Akhtar, working off a script she has written with Reema Kagti, stuffed with pulsating dialogue by Vijay Maurya and four young rappers, takes this one-line premise and runs with it, and gives us a film which shines a light on those who have, over the years, been made invisible in mainstream Bollywood: the minorities, the underclass, the dispossessed, people who have no access to the fancy arcades of wealthy India.‚Äù
