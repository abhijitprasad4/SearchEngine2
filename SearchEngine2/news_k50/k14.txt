Katrina Kaif wants a BOYFRIEND in 2019; is Vicky Kaushal listening?

Katrina Kaif wants a boyfriend and doesn't want to remain single in 2019. Read on. 

Katrina Kaif has been single for quite some time and while we wish to see her dating soon, looks like Kat herself is bored of being single. Yes, you read it right! The actress who appeared on the episode of Famously Filmfare was all things candid as she confessed to wanting to be in a relationship. When Katrina was asked about the things she wishes for in 2019, she told Filmfare that apart from a boyfriend, she also wants to become a producer. 
 
She said, "A Filmfare Award, A boyfriend, I don’t want to be single now and I want to have my own production company.” Well, well, we can't wait for her to be in a relationship as well. BTW, is Vicky Kaushal listening? Given that he almost fainted listening to Karan Johar say that Katrina said she would look better with Vicky Kaushal on-screen. Harleen Sethi, you have something to worry about now! 
 
Katrina was earlier in a relationship with Ranbir Kapoor for five years before their public break-up. Ranbir then went on to be with Alia Bhatt, but that hasn't changed Katrina's equation with Alia. Opening up about her life post break-up, Katrina had earlier said, “What human nature does is that when we have something, or someone, to focus on, we can also shift a lot of our attention there, so we are not really forced to look at ourselves in any great perspective. We’re able to kind of shift a lot of responsibility—on decisions, for happiness, for entertainment and motivation".
