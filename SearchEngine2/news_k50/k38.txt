Katrina Kaif on how Ayan Mukerji introduced Alia Bhatt to her even before Student of the Year - details inside

Katrina Kaif recently appeared on a celebrity talk show where she had some very interesting unknown facts to reveal. From opening up about the failure of her last outings Zero and Thugs Of Hindostan, to Salman Khan's reaction on her coming onboard for Bharat,  the actress unearthed a lot of hidden secrets of B-town. 

Take, for instance, this latest disclosure about how she was introduced to her gal pal Alia Bhatt by Brahmastra director Ayan Mukerji. In a recent interaction on Famously Filmfare, the 35-year-old actress got real candid about her friendship with the Gully Boy actress and how it has grown over the years. She was heard saying on the chat show,



"Alia was part of our friends circle  of Ayan, me and there was a group of us. She still hadn't started Student Of The Year and Ayan introduced us to her saying, 'This is Alia, she's going to be doing a film with Karan. They're going to be starting Student Of The Year. Then we always had a nice, you know, a warm equation. I think when she started coming to train with Yasmin, that's when we started seeing each other more and then I would say, come train with me.

On being asked, "And now that she is dating an ex of yours (Ranbir Kapoor) doesn't hamper your relationship with her?" To this, she candidly responded, "Who she was dating was not relevant to the equation that I shared with her so why should that equation change."
