Oh so pretty! Katrina Kaif looks mesmerising in this new BTS still from the sets of Bharat - view pic

Salman Khan fans can't keep calm when one of his films is about to release. And needless to say, Eid looks promising this time too with the release of the much anticipated Bharat, which is being helmed by Ali Abbas Zafar. Yes, Priyanka Chopra's walkout from the film caused much frenzy but Katrina Kaif replacing her only helped in fueling the buzz because of her on-screen chemistry with Salman. In fact, we missed her a lot in the grand teaser that was released earlier.

However, it wouldn't be wrong to say that Kat has been giving her fans a little something while they wait for the trailer, to see her in her new curly look. If you haven't followed the trail, she has been posting Insta stories and boy, are we hooked! Not just that, she has now posted a picture from the sets, during the shooting as she can be seen in her costume and it's too beautiful for words. The actress has draped a saree and is looking absolutely gorgeous in the guise of her character. Check it out here!

Now, you know! Talking about Bharat, it is set across several decades and will show Salmanâ€™s character in various avatars which will showcase his journey from 18 to 60 years. It is the official remake of a Korean film titled, Ode To My Father. She is coming together with Salman and director Ali Abbas Zafar after Tiger Zinda Hai and we can't wait for the trio to recreate the magic. The film also stars Disha Patani, Sunil Grover and Nora Fatehi in pivotal roles. But while you wait, (re)watch the teaser here.
