In curly braided hair and an orange saree, Katrina Kaif's smile on the sets of Bharat is winning our hearts

Of late, Katrina Kaif has been giving us glimpses of her look from the sets of Bharat. Her de-glam with curly hairdo in a simple saree, hasn't been making the wait easy for the film’s release. In fact, today, Katrina shared another photo from the sets in an orange saree and curly hair tied into a messy braid. But more than that, her adorable smile is winning our hearts.

The trailer of Bharat, which is one of the most anticipated films in 2019, dropped last month and fans couldn’t keep calm. The film shows different avatars of Salman Khan that begins from the Independence era. According to the official statement, Bharat will map the story of a country and man knit together. On her recent post, Katrina wrote, “आन सेट 4 भारत”.

Meanwhile, Katrina shared a lot about her life recently in an interview with Famously Filmfare. Besides spilling the beans how she wanted a different eye colour like Kareena Kapoor, wanting to not be single this year and to start her own production company, Katrina too shared how Salman reacted when she was signed up for Bharat after Priyanka Chopra’s exit. “Salman Khan didn't call me at all, he didn't say a word to me. And this is the truth. He did not even call me.. Even when I signed the film, he didn't call me,” she said.

Meanwhile, Bharat also stars Sunil Grover, Disha Patani, Nora Fatehi, Tabu and a cameo appearance by Varun Dhawan. Directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, it is slated to release on Eid this year. Bharat is based on the 2014 South Korean film Ode To My Father.
