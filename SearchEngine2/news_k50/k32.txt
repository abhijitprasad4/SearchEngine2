Katrina Kaif, Isabelle Kaif and Ali Abbas Zafar spotted at a Mumbai hotspot



Katrina Kaif and director Ali Abbas Zafar are really close buddies. The duo hit it off while shooting for Mere Brother Ki Dulhan in 2011 and their friendship grew over the years. Ali and Katrina then reunited to work on Tiger Zinda Hai in 2017 and are now working on Bharat in 2019. The actor and the director are often spotted chilling together. Last night, we snapped Katrina as she stepped out for dinner with sister Isabelle Kaif.

Isabelle is also set to make her Bollywood debut this year with Time To Dance alongside Sooraj Pancholi. The sisters were accompanied by Ali as all of them met at a popular hotspot in Mumbai. The celebs happily posed for the shutterbugs. Katrina and Isabelle were clicked leaving together in the same ride, while Ali left separately. Check out their pictures right hereâ€¦
