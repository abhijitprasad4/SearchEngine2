Here’s the reason behind Alia Bhatt’s sad face in photos with Ranbir Kapoor

If just like us, you too are mostly glued to the internet, you must have come across a picture of Alia Bhatt with Ranbir Kapoor from the sets of Brahmastra. Soon after that picture went viral on the internet, fans started guessing that all’s not well in RK and Alia’s love paradise. However, that not being the case, soon the reports of a tiff between the lovebirds died. After that episode, it was recently at Gully Boy screening when pictures and a few videos of #Ralia came out where the actress apparently looked upset and Ranbir angry. After the screening pictures surfaced online, the netizens stormed the social media fan pages with sympathies for Alia thinking she again had a tiff with her actor boyfriend. 

Interestingly, for those of you who don’t know, Alia has a tendency of zoning out while she’s thinking about something. Talking about the same, Alia told a leading portal, “Anybody who looks at my face tells me, ‘Alia, why are you looking so sad? Please cheer up’. I tend to zone out a lot. But only a few people will know that this is my usual face when I’m focused or thinking about something. So, I just can’t believe that my frown has become a sensation and a new story is being cooked up everyday about how I’m sad. It’s not true. I don’t find the need to clarify it because in my heart, if I know what the truth is, nothing else really matters.”

The young actress further stated that she didn’t get much affected with such reports, nor did she feel the need to clarify anything because she knows the truth and nothing else matters to her.
