Katrina Kaif reveals that whenever she is sad, she dances to THIS Salman Khan song from the ‘90s – find out

Bollywood diva Katrina Kaif, who is busy shooting the final schedule of her upcoming film Bharat with Salman Khan, had appeared on Famously Filmfare season 2. Her episode was aired recently, in which, the actress made a number of revelations about her movies, personal life and so on. During a Q&A round, she was asked about her favourite dance move and the actress had an instant reply – O O Jane Jaana, the popular Salman Khan song from the ‘90s film Pyaar Kiya Toh Darna Kya with Kajol.

“O O Jane Jaana, that’s my favourite one. It’s too funny and I just love it. It’s my hobby and I do it when I’m feeling low. On the set, if I’m feeling low or something I just start performing to the song,” in a candid mood, Katrina Kaif said.




The actress was also asked that if a biopic was made on her, which Bollywood superstar would she want to be narrating her story? While the interviewer gave her options like Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, Katrina joked that Salman could be the one narrating the story considering he’ll have a fairly large role in the film.

She also revealed during the interview that she is single and ready to mingle. The actress hopes to find love this year, especially after all her contemporaries like Sonam Kapoor, Deepika Padukone, Priyanka Chopra and Anushka Sharma got married.

Katrina has been in the news lately for turning down new projects as she wanted to keep her focus on her upcoming film (Bharat) with Salman. The actress had reportedly pulled out of Remo D’Souza’s Street Dancer for the same reason and was later replaced by Varun Dhawan.
