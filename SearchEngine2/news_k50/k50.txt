Alia reveals Mahesh Bhatt was absent during her childhood: Friendship started when I entered films

Alia Bhatt revealed that her father Mahesh Bhatt was extremely busy with work during her childhood and was hardly home.

lia Bhatt may share an extremely close bond with her father Mahesh Bhatt now, but that was not always the case. On a recent chat show, she revealed that he was too consumed with work during her growing up years.

"For me, he was always like a celebrity who would walk in to the house. I didn't miss him as such because I did not really have him. But after a couple of years, he made sure he spent some time with us, played board games," she said.

The filmmaker became much closer to his daughter when she entered the world of films "The real friendship started when I entered the Bollywood industry and I understand how it must have been for him. It is such a consuming job," the actress said.

On the work front, Alia has been basking in the success of Zoya Akhtar's Gully Boy, which hit the theatres this Valentine's Day. Not only has the film, which features Ranveer Singh as an underground rapper, managed to cross the Rs 70-crore milestone in its extended opening weekend, it has also managed to bowl over critics.

India Today critic Ananya Bhattacharya gave Gully Boy 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, "Alia Bhatt brings her effusive charm on screen in Gully Boy. She does not have a lot to do in the film and that's a real shame. Safina's story is not fleshed out in Gully Boy. Sure, the film is on Ranveer's character, but we deserved more of Alia. In her limited screentime, the Bhatt kid shows what stuff she is made of."

Alia's mother Soni Razdan was also "blown away" by her natural performance. She tweeted, "You shine through the film like a light. You infused your character with such charm and played her so engagingly and effortlessly! Blown away by your ability to once again be so real and natural. Many girls will be inspired by spunky Safina. Outstanding!"
