I don’t want to be single now.” – Katrina Kaif

Katrina Kaif is quite a stunner. She has been in the industry for over 16 years and still remains as relevant as ever. The actress has made an impact with her dance moves for years now and her characters in films like Namaste London, Rajneeti, New York, Zero and more have been etched in peoples minds and hearts. On the final episode of Famously Filmfare season 2, Jitesh Pillaai, Editor, Filmfare spoke to the actress about a lot of things ranging from love to changing professional dynamics. When she was questioned about why she isn’t dating anyone currently, she said, “ I really don’t know. I don’t honestly know that I ever feel the need to do that. There is nothing wrong with going and meeting someone, but I think if you are not a person like that, then it’s tough, right?”


She was further questioned about the things she wishes for in 2019, to which the actress quickly replied saying, “A Filmfare Award, A boyfriend, I don’t want to be single now and I want to have my own production company.” Visit our YoutTube channel Filmfare Official to catch all the highlights from this episode.
